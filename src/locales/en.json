At Kriptos, I supported SOC 2 Type II certification by monitoring security controls and triaging vulnerabilities, then transitioned to the dev team where I delivered 37,000+ lines of production code for the Update Manager module. My toolkit? Legal expertise, experience working at the edge of what's possible with today's tech, a cybersecurity postgraduate diploma from UT Austin, software engineering and cybersecurity diplomas from BrainStation (Konrad Group), a financial accounting certificate from HBS Online, a cloud certification from AWS, ongoing training for CompTIA Security+, and an obsession with efficiency.",

  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "Do I need SOC 2 or ISO 27001?",
    "a1": "It depends on your target market. SOC 2 is what US enterprise buyers expect in procurement—if you're selling SaaS or handling data for US clients, start there. ISO 27001 carries more weight in Europe and internationally. Many companies pursuing both start with SOC 2 for quicker wins, then layer on ISO 27001 for global reach.",
    "q2": "How long does SOC 2 certification take?",
    "a2": "A realistic timeline is 3–6 months for Type I and 6–12 months for Type II, depending on your current security posture. Type I covers policy design and a point-in-time audit. Type II adds an observation period (3–12 months) where controls must operate effectively. Companies in emerging markets often need extra time to formalize policies and choose tooling.",
    "q3": "What is the difference between SOC 2 Type I and Type II?",
    "a3": "Type I evaluates whether your security controls are properly designed at a specific point in time. Type II evaluates whether those controls operated effectively over a period—typically 3 to 12 months. Enterprise buyers generally require Type II because it demonstrates sustained operational security, not just a one-time snapshot.",
    "q4": "How much does SOC 2 certification cost?",
    "a4": "Costs typically range from $20,000 to $100,000+ depending on company size, scope, and readiness. Major cost drivers include compliance automation tooling ($10,000–$30,000/year), auditor fees ($10,000–$50,000), and internal effort for gap remediation. Startups with clean cloud-native infrastructure tend toward the lower end.",
    "q5": "Do I still need SOC 2 if I use AWS or Azure?",
    "a5": "Yes—cloud providers operate under a shared responsibility model. AWS and Azure secure the infrastructure, but you're responsible for data handling, access controls, application security, and operational procedures. A SOC 2 audit evaluates your controls, not your cloud provider's.",
    "q6": "Is SOC 2 required by law?",
    "a6": "No. SOC 2 is a voluntary framework developed by the AICPA—it's not mandated by any law or regulation. That said, it's become a de facto requirement in B2B software sales. Enterprise buyers, investors, and procurement teams routinely require a SOC 2 report before signing contracts.",
    "q7": "Can a startup get SOC 2 without a dedicated security team?",
    "a7": "Absolutely. Many startups achieve SOC 2 using compliance automation platforms like Vanta, Drata, or Secureframe that handle evidence collection, policy templates, and continuous monitoring. A single engineer or operations lead can typically manage the process with some external guidance.",
    "q8": "Does ISO 27001 make you GDPR compliant?",
    "a8": "They overlap in areas like access control and incident management, but ISO 27001 alone doesn't cover GDPR's specific requirements—data subject rights, legal bases for processing, cross-border transfers, and supervisory authority reporting are all outside its scope. <a href=\"/blog/iso-27001-not-gdpr-compliant/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more</a>",
    "q9": "How does the EU AI Act affect companies outside Europe?",
    "a9": "The EU AI Act applies to any company whose AI systems are placed on the EU market or whose outputs are used within the EU—regardless of where the company is headquartered. This extraterritorial reach follows the GDPR model, meaning companies outside Europe selling AI-powered products to EU customers must comply. <a href=\"/blog/direct-effect-ai-act/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more</a>",
    "q10": "What legal risks should AI products prepare for?",
    "a10": "AI products face legal exposure across intellectual property, data privacy, and regulation. Key risks include copyright claims over training data, liability for AI-generated outputs, GDPR violations, and emerging AI-specific laws like the EU AI Act. Establishing clear data provenance and compliance frameworks early is critical. <a href=\"/blog/ai-copyright-lawsuits-that-matter/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more</a>"
