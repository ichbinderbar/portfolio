After years of working at the intersection of law and technology, I've decided to start sharing what I've learned. This blog will cover topics I'm passionate about:

## What to Expect

**Compliance & Security**: Practical insights on SOC 2, ISO 27001, and building security into your processes from day one. Not the boring checkbox stuff—real strategies that work.

**Legal Tech**: How technology is transforming legal work, from AI-powered trademark analysis to workflow automation.

**Building Secure Software**: Lessons from the trenches on developing enterprise-grade applications without sacrificing speed.

## Why Now?

I've spent years helping businesses navigate the complex world of data security and compliance. From supporting SOC 2 Type II certification at Kriptos to building Markatzy's AI-powered trademark platform, I've seen firsthand how the right approach to security can be a competitive advantage, not just a checkbox.
