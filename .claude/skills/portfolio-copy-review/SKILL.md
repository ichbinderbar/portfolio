# Portfolio Copy Review

Comprehensive review for portfolio websites, personal branding content, and professional copy targeting recruiters and potential clients.

**Frameworks**: Cialdini's 7 Principles of Persuasion, StoryBrand SB7, AIDA, PAS

## Review Process

Execute all checks in order, providing actionable feedback with specific text references and rewrites.

---

## 1. Value Proposition Clarity (CRITICAL)

### The 5-Second Test

Within 5 seconds of reading, visitors should understand:
1. **Who you are** (role/identity)
2. **What you do** (services/skills)
3. **Who you help** (target audience)
4. **Why you're different** (unique value)

```
// ❌ VAGUE
"Passionate developer who loves creating amazing experiences"

// ✅ CLEAR
"Cybersecurity-focused full-stack developer helping companies
ship secure applications faster"
```

### USP Formula

Use: **What + Who + How**

```
// Template
"I help [TARGET AUDIENCE] achieve [DESIRED OUTCOME] through [YOUR UNIQUE METHOD]"

// Example
"I help IP law firms automate trademark monitoring through AI-powered
conflict detection—delivering analysis that used to take days in minutes"
```

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Hero section answers "What do you do?" in under 10 words
- [ ] Unique differentiator is immediately visible (not buried)
- [ ] Target audience is explicitly or implicitly clear
- [ ] No jargon that confuses non-technical readers
- [ ] Value is stated in terms of outcomes, not just skills

## 2. Cialdini's 7 Principles of Persuasion

### 2.1 Authority

Establish expertise without boasting.

```
// ❌ WEAK
"I know a lot about security"

// ✅ STRONG
"Led SOC 2 Type II certification at Kriptos, integrating security
scanning across 220+ repositories"
```

**Authority signals to include:**
- Certifications (AWS, CompTIA, etc.)
- Notable clients/employers (logo display)
- Quantified achievements
- Educational credentials from recognized institutions
- Speaking, publications, or teaching

### 2.2 Social Proof

Show that others trust you.

```
// ❌ MISSING
[No testimonials, no client logos, no metrics]

// ✅ PRESENT
"Trusted by IP law firms across Ecuador"
"219 commits, 37,000+ lines of code—3rd top contributor"
"Near-perfect approval rate on 100+ immigration cases annually"
```

**Social proof elements:**
- Client testimonials (with names/photos if possible)
- Employer/client logos
- GitHub contribution stats
- Project metrics (users served, revenue generated)
- Awards or recognition

### 2.3 Reciprocity

Give value before asking for anything.

```
// ❌ ONLY TAKING
"Hire me for your project"

// ✅ GIVING FIRST
"Download my free security checklist for startups"
"Read my guide on trademark protection basics"
```

**Reciprocity tactics:**
- Free resources (guides, checklists, templates)
- Helpful blog posts
- Open source contributions
- Free consultations or audits

### 2.4 Scarcity

Create urgency without being manipulative.

```
// ❌ FAKE SCARCITY
"Only 2 spots left!!!" (when false)

// ✅ AUTHENTIC SCARCITY
"Currently taking on 2 new clients per quarter"
"Limited availability due to ongoing Kriptos commitment"
```

### 2.5 Liking

Be relatable and human.

```
// ❌ ROBOTIC
"Professional with 5 years experience in technology sector"

// ✅ HUMAN
"When I'm not securing applications, you'll find me trail running
through Ecuador or attempting to surf on my oversized funboard"
```

**Liking elements:**
- Personal photo (professional but approachable)
- Hobbies/interests that humanize
- Origin story or journey
- Conversational tone

### 2.6 Commitment & Consistency

Guide visitors through small yeses.

```
// ❌ BIG ASK IMMEDIATELY
"Sign a 6-month contract"

// ✅ GRADUATED COMMITMENT
"Book a free 15-min call" → "Let's do a paid discovery session" → "Here's the proposal"
```

**Commitment ladder:**
1. Read content (lowest commitment)
2. Download free resource
3. Book free call
4. Paid consultation
5. Full engagement

### 2.7 Unity

Create shared identity.

```
// ❌ GENERIC
"I work with businesses"

// ✅ TRIBE-BUILDING
"Fellow attorneys who've made the leap to tech"
"For founders who know security isn't optional"
```

---

## 3. StoryBrand SB7 Framework

Position the visitor as the HERO, yourself as the GUIDE.

### The 7 Elements

| Element | Question | Your Answer |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Character** | What does your visitor want? | Secure app, protected trademark, working website |
| **Problem** | What's blocking them? | No time, no expertise, fear of getting it wrong |
| **Guide** | Why should they trust you? | Credentials + empathy |
| **Plan** | What's the path forward? | Clear 3-step process |
| **Call to Action** | What should they do now? | "Book a call", "Start free trial" |
| **Failure** | What happens if they don't act? | Security breach, trademark stolen, lost clients |
| **Success** | What does winning look like? | Peace of mind, growth, saved time |

### Application Examples

```
// ❌ BRAND AS HERO
"I built an amazing AI platform that analyzes trademarks..."

// ✅ CUSTOMER AS HERO
"You've built a brand worth protecting. Markatzy monitors thousands
of trademark filings so you can catch conflicts before they become crises."
```

### Problem/Agitate Structure

```
// External Problem (surface level)
"Monitoring trademark filings manually is time-consuming"

// Internal Problem (emotional)
"You worry about missing a conflict that could cost your client thousands"

// Philosophical Problem (why it matters)
"Your expertise should go toward strategy, not data entry"
```

## 4. Copywriting Formulas

### 4.1 AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

Best for: Landing pages, service descriptions

```
ATTENTION: "Your trademark could be stolen right now"
INTEREST: "3,000+ brands filed last month. Are any too similar to your clients'?"
DESIRE: "AI-powered monitoring catches conflicts you'd miss—in seconds"
ACTION: "Start your free trial"
```

### 4.2 PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)

Best for: Service pages, email outreach, ads

```
PROBLEM: "Manual trademark monitoring takes 10+ hours per gazette issue"
AGITATE: "That's 10 hours you're not billing. And you still might miss something."
SOLUTION: "Markatzy scans every filing automatically and flags the conflicts that matter"
```

### 4.3 BAB (Before → After → Bridge)

Best for: Case studies, about sections

```
BEFORE: "Law firms were drowning in trademark paperwork"
AFTER: "Now they deliver conflict reports in hours, not days"
BRIDGE: "Markatzy bridges that gap with AI-powered analysis"
```

## 5. Dual Audience Optimization

### For Recruiters

**What they look for:**
- Proof of skills (not just claims)
- Problem-solving ability
- Growth trajectory
- Cultural fit signals
- Technical depth

**Recruiter-focused copy:**
```
// ❌ VAGUE
"Experienced in security and development"

// ✅ SPECIFIC
"Integrated SonarCloud and Amazon Inspector across 220+ repos,
configuring ~100 CI/CD pipelines for automated security scanning"
```

**Key metrics to include:**
- Lines of code / commits
- Users served / processed
- Time saved / efficiency gains
- Approval rates / success rates
- Team size managed

### For Potential Clients

**What they look for:**
- Can you solve MY problem?
- Do you understand my industry?
- What results can I expect?
- What's the process?
- Can I trust you?

**Client-focused copy:**
```
// ❌ TECHNICAL
"I build Next.js applications with tRPC and Prisma"

// ✅ OUTCOME-FOCUSED
"I build websites that actually convert visitors into customers—
fast-loading, mobile-friendly, and optimized for search engines"
```

### Balancing Both Audiences

Use **section targeting:**
- Hero/About: Broad enough for both audiences
- Projects/Case Studies: Technical depth for recruiters, outcomes for clients
- Services page: Client-focused
- Resume/Skills: Recruiter-focused

---

## 6. UX Writing & Microcopy

### CTAs (Call-to-Action)

```
// ❌ GENERIC
"Submit" / "Click here" / "Learn more"

// ✅ SPECIFIC + BENEFIT
"Book your free strategy call"
"Download the security checklist"
"See how it works (2 min video)"
"Start protecting your brand"
```

**CTA formula:** Verb + Object + Benefit/Outcome

### Form Labels & Buttons

```
// ❌ FRICTION
"Submit your information"
"Sign up for our newsletter"

// ✅ LOW FRICTION
"Get started free"
"Send me the guide"
"Let's talk"
```

### Error/Empty States

```
// ❌ GENERIC
"No results found"

// ✅ HELPFUL
"No projects match that filter. Try selecting fewer categories,
or view all projects."
```

### Trust Microcopy

Place near conversion points:
- "Free 15-min call, no obligation"
- "Your email stays private—I hate spam too"
- "Response within 24 hours"

---

## 7. Portfolio-Specific Best Practices

### Project Descriptions

**Structure each project with:**
1. **Problem** - What challenge did this solve?
2. **Solution** - What did you build?
3. **Your Role** - What specifically did YOU do?
4. **Tech Stack** - What tools/technologies?
5. **Results** - What was the impact?

```
// ❌ WEAK
"Built an e-commerce platform using Next.js"

// ✅ STRONG
"Built La Pampa's complete e-commerce platform from scratch—
product catalog, cart, checkout with PayPhone payments.
The owner can now sell frozen fruit pulp online with zero
inventory management headaches."
```

### About Section

**Include:**
- Your unique story (how you got here)
- Your "why" (what drives you)
- Credibility markers (education, experience)
- Human elements (personality, interests)
- Clear statement of who you help

**Avoid:**
- Third-person voice ("Juan is a developer...")
- Generic adjectives ("passionate", "detail-oriented", "hardworking")
- Listing skills without context
- Jargon overload

### Cross-Disciplinary Positioning

For multi-skilled professionals:

```
// ❌ CONFUSING
"Attorney / Developer / Accountant / Cybersecurity"

// ✅ INTEGRATED
"I bring a rare combination to software: legal training that
spots compliance risks, security expertise that prevents breaches,
and the development skills to actually fix what I find."
```

**Frame overlapping skills as superpowers, not confusion.**

## 8. Language & Tone

### Power Words to Use

| Category | Words |
|----------|-------|
| **Trust** | proven, guaranteed, secure, reliable, trusted |
| **Urgency** | now, today, limited, before, while |
| **Exclusivity** | exclusive, only, first, insider, selected |
| **Value** | free, bonus, save, results, ROI |
| **Action** | get, start, discover, unlock, transform |

### Words to Avoid

| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| "Passionate" | Overused, vague | Show passion through specifics |
| "Detail-oriented" | Generic | "Caught the bug that would have cost $50k" |
| "Team player" | Cliché | "Led 3-person frontend team" |
| "Innovative" | Empty | Describe the actual innovation |
| "Leverage" | Jargon | "Use" |
| "Synergy" | Corporate speak | "Work together" |

### Voice Guidelines

```
// ❌ STIFF/FORMAL
"It would be my pleasure to discuss your requirements at your earliest convenience"

// ✅ CONFIDENT/CONVERSATIONAL
"Let's talk about your project—I respond within 24 hours"
```

---

## 9. Technical SEO Copy Considerations

### Headlines (H1, H2)

- Include target keywords naturally
- Front-load important words
- Keep H1 under 60 characters

### Meta Descriptions

```
// Template
[WHO] + [DOES WHAT] + [FOR WHOM] + [CTA/DIFFERENTIATOR]

// Example
"Juan Idrovo—cybersecurity-focused full-stack developer helping
companies ship secure applications. View projects and get in touch."
```

### Alt Text for Images

```
// ❌ EMPTY OR GENERIC
alt="" or alt="image"

// ✅ DESCRIPTIVE
alt="Screenshot of Markatzy trademark monitoring dashboard showing conflict alerts"
```
